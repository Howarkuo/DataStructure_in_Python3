## Learning Resource

- Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition, MIT press. By Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
- Data Structure and Algorithm: Daniel M. Kane, Alexander Kulikov, Pavel Pevzner, Michael Levin, and Neil Rhodes, from UC San Diego and HSE University.



## Three of the most common and most generally applicable algorithmic design techniques. 
1. Greedy algorithms.
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Dynamic Programming

## Level of Design

* **Naive Algorithm** : Definition of algorithm, slow (e.g: Fibonacci Summation)
* **Algorithm by ways of standard Tools**: Standard techniques
* **Optimized Algorithm**: Improve existing algorithm
